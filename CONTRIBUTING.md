# Contributing

## Welcome

Welcome to this project. We want to thank you in advance if you wish to contribute to it.

## Testing

To test the project you'll need to have a Game Maker Studio 2 license and run it with the play or debug button.

## How to submit changes

To submit changes you need to create a branch from develop where you will be able to work on your feature or fix. When you’re done, you will have to create a pull request. Once reviewed, your branch may be merged in develop. See the **[PR and commit standards](#pr-and-commit-standards)** as well to keep the git clean 😉
